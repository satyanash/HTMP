Advantages

Some very obvious and not so obvious advantages:

1
Will completely eliminate spam.
This is simply because this form is completely free from the problem of unsolicitied mail.
Keeping the mail available until the target has actually read the mail is very inefficient for spammers.


2
This form of mail is completely dependent on the sender.
The receiver has complete independence regarding whether to fetch mail from a given host or not.

3
If an existing subscribed email address starts sending unsoliccited mail to the user, all he has to do then is to unsubscribe from the sender's mail address.

4
It works on existing HTTP servers, so no new implementations really need to take place in order to implement this on the server side.


Disadvantages

1
Ideally, encrytion should not be a part of the protocol specification itself.
Transmission security should be achieved by wrapping the existing protocol with any other standardized or custom encryption methodologies.
For example TLS or SSL.

2
Depends on Assymetric key encryption. Will not really work with symmetric key encryption without changes to the specification.
Plus key management becomes difficult when there are a large number of hosts to be connected to.

3
This method will not scale properly as the amount of mail to be received increases.

4
The encrypted email message is publicly visible, which may be decrypted easily in case the encryption technique is compromised in the future.

5
This form of email will require the client program to poll all of the subscribed senders at short intervals in order to get regular email updates.
When the amount of subscribed senders runs into the thousands, it can be a problem.



Security Considerations

Form of encrpytion used should be strong enough as the encrypted mail will be visible to all the public.
